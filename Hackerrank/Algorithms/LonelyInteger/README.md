==============

There are N integers in an array A. All but one integer occurs in pairs. Your task is to find out that number that occurs only once.

###Input Format###

The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating N integers in the array A. Next line contains N integers each separated by a single space.

###Constraints###

`1 <= N < 100`
`N % 2 = 1 ( N is an odd number )`
`0 <= i <= 100, âˆ€ i âˆˆ A`

###Output Format###

Output (S) which is the number that occurs only once.

###Explanation###

In the first input, we see only 1 element and that element is the answer (1)
In the second input, we see 3 elements, 1 is repeated twice, the only other element 2 is the answer
In the third input, we see 5 elements, 1 and 0 are repeated twice, the other element 2 is the answer
