Split the Phone Numbers
=======================

There is a list of phone numbers which needs the attention of a text processing expert. As an expert in regular expressions, you are being roped in for the task. A phone number directory can reveal a lot such as country codes and local area codes. The only constraint is that one should know how to process it correctly.

A Phone number is of the following format

    [Country code]-[Local Area Code]-[Number]

There might either be a ‘-‘ ( ascii value 45), or a ‘ ‘ ( space, ascii value 32) between the segments
Where the country and local area codes can have 1-3 numerals each and the number section can have 4-10 numerals each.

And so, if we tried to apply the a regular expression with groups on this phone number: 1-425-9854706

We’d get: 
Group 1 = 1
Group 2 = 425
Group 3 = 9854706

You will be provided a list of N phone numbers which conform to the pattern described above. Your task is to split it into the country code, local area code and the number.

### Input:

N, where N is the number of tests. 

This will be followed by N lines containing N phone numbers in the format specified above.

### Constraints:

* 1 <= N <= 20
* There might either be a hyphen, or a space between the segments
* The country and local area codes can have 1-3 numerals each and the number section can have 4-10 numerals each.

### Output:

Your output will contain N lines.

CountryCode=[Country Code],LocalAreaCode=[Local Area Code],Number=[Number]

### Sample Input:

    2
    1 877 2638277
    91-011-23413627

### Sample Output:

    CountryCode=1,LocalAreaCode=877,Number=2638277
    CountryCode=91,LocalAreaCode=011,Number=23413627
