PRNG Sequence Guessing
======================

Given a time range during which the Java <code>Random</code> generator was seeded and the last ten output values of <code>random.nextInt(1000)</code>, guess the next value to be output by the generator.

### Input:

The first line of input is a number N < 10 indicating the number of test cases to follow. For each of the N test cases, a line will follow containing two space separated Unix timestamps representing the time during which the random number generator instance was created. The range between the two timestamps will be at most 1000000. Ten numbers sequentially generated by the same <code>Random</code> instanceâ€™s <code>nextInt(1000)</code> function will follow, one on each line.

### Output:

For each test case, output a line consisting of the seed used to create the generator and the next 10 integers that are output from <code>random.nextInt(1000)</code>, separated by spaces.
