Game of Thrones - I
===================

King Robert has 7 kingdoms under his rule. He gets to know from Raven that Dothrakis are to wage a war against him soon. But, he knows Dothrakis need to cross the narrow river to enter his dynasty. There is only one bridge that connects both sides of the river which is sealed by a huge door.

The king wants to lock the door so that the Dothrakis canâ€™t enter. But, to lock the door you need a key that is a palindrome of an anagram of a certain string.

The king has a list of words. For each given word, can you help the king in figuring out if any anagram of it can be a palindrome or not?

### Input:
