Intro to Tutorial Challenges
============================

### About Tutorial Challenges

Many of the challenges on HackerRank are difficult and assume you already know the relevant algorithms very well. These tutorial challenges are different. They break down algorithmic concepts into smaller challenges, so you can learn the algorithm by doing the challenges.

These challenges are intended for people who know some programming and now want to learn some algorithms. You could be a student majoring in Computers, a self-taught programmer, or an experienced developer who wants an active algorithms review!

The first series of challenges covers sorting. These are the different challenges:

### Tutorial Challenges - Sorting

Insertion Sort challenges

* Insertion Sort 1 - Inserting
* Insertion Sort 2 - Sorting
* Correctness of Algorithms
* Running Time of Algorithms

Quicksort challenges

* Quicksort 1 - Partition
* Quicksort 2 - Sorting
* Quicksort In-place (advanced)
* Running time of Quicksort

Counting sort challenges

* Counting Sort 1 - Counting
* Counting Sort 2 - Simple sort
* Counting Sort 3 - Preparing
* Full Counting Sort (advanced)

There will also be some challenges where you apply what you learned.

### About the Challenges

The challenges will describe some topic and then ask you to code a solution. As you progress through the challenges, you will learn concepts in algorithms. On each challenge, you will receive input on STDIN and you will need to print the correct output to STDOUT.

For many challenges, helper methods will be provided for you to process the input into a useful format, like an array. You can use these methods to get started with your program, or you can write your own input methods if you want. Your code just needs to print the right output to each test case.

### Sample Challenge

This is a simple challenge to get things started. Given a sorted array (ar) and a number (V), can you print the index location of V in the array?

{The next section describes the input format. You can often skip it if you are using included methods. }

### Input:

There will be three lines of input:

* V - the value you are looking for.
* n - the size of the array.
* ar - n numbers that makes up the array.

### Output:

Output the index of V in the array.

{The next section describes the constraints and ranges of the input. Occasionally you want to check here to see how big the input could be. }

### Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 1000 
* -1000 <= x <= 1000, x ∈ ar

{This “sample” shows the first input case. It is often useful to skip to the sample to understand a challenge. }

### Sample Input:

    4
    6
    1 4 5 7 9 12

### Sample Output:

    1

### Explanation:

V = 4. The 4 is located in the 1<sup>th</sup> spot on the array, so the answer is 1.
