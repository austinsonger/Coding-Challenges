Angry Children 2
================
Bill Gates is on one of his philanthropic journeys to a village in Utopia. He has N packets of candies and would like to distribute one packet to each of the K children in the village (each packet may contain different number of candies). To avoid a fight between the children, he would like to pick K out of N packets such that the unfairness is minimized.

Suppose the K packets have (x1, x2, x3,â€¦.xk) candies in them, where xi denotes the number of candies in the ith packet, then we define unfairness as

<img alt="equation" src ="https://hr-filepicker.s3.amazonaws.com/angry-children-2-eq-1.png" />

where `|a|` denotes the absolute value of `a`.

###Input Format###
The first line contains an integer N.
The second line contains an integer K. N lines follow each integer containing the candy in the ith packet.

###Output Format###
A single integer which will be minimum unfairness.

###Constraints###

```
2<=N<=105
2<=K<=N 
0<= number of candies in each packet <=10^9
```

###Sample Input:###

```
7
3
10
100
300
200
1000
20
30
```

###Sample Output:###

```
40
```

###Explanation:###

Bill Gates will choose packets having 10, 20 and 30 candies.So unfairness will be |10-20| + |20-30| + |30-10| = 40. It will be minimum as compared to any other distribution which can be verified .


###Sample Input:###

```
10
4
1
2
3
4
10
20
30
40
100
200
```

###Sample Output:###

```
10
```

###Explanation:###

Bill Gates will choose 4 packets having 1,2,3 and 4 candies. So, unfairness will be |1-2| + |1-3| + |1-4| + |2-3| + |2-4| + |3-4| = 10
