Minimum Draws
=============

Jim is off to a party and is searching for a matching pair of socks. His drawer is filled with socks, each pair of a different color. In its worst case scenario, how many socks (x) should Jim remove from his drawer after which he finds a matching pair?

### Input:

The first line contains the number of test cases T.

Next T lines contains an integer N which indicates the total pairs of socks present in the drawer.

### Output:

Print the number of Draws (x) Jim makes in the worst case scenario.

### Constraints:

* 1 <= T <= 1000
* 0 < N < 10<sup>6</sup>

### Sample Input:

    2
    1
    2

### Sample Output:

    2
    3

### Explanation:

Case 1 : A pair of socks are present, hence exactly 2 draws for the socks to match.

Case 2 : 2 pair of socks are present in the drawer. The first and the second draw might result in 2 socks of different color. The 3rd socks picked will definitely match one of previously picked socks. Hence, 3.
