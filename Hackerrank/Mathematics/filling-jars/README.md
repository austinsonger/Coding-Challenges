Filling Jars
============

Animesh has N empty candy jars numbered from 1 to N with infinite capacity. He performs M operations. Each operation is described by 3 integers a, b and k where a and b are index of the jars and k is the number of candies to be added inside each jar with index between a and b (both inclusive). Can you tell the average number of candies after M operations?

### Input:

The first line contains two integers N and M separated by a single space.

M lines follow. Each of the M lines contain three integers a, b and k separated by single space.

### Output:

A single line containing the average number of candies across N jars, *rounded down* to the nearest integer.

**Note**
*Rounded down* means finding the greatest integer which is less than or equal to given number. Eg, *13.65* and *13.23* is rounded down to *13* while *12.98* is rounded down to *12*.

### Constraints:

* 3 <= N <= 10<sup>7</sup>
* 1 <= M <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 <= a <= b <= N
* 0 <= k <= 10<sup>6</sup>

**Note**

Chocolate needed to be served in size of 1 x 1 size pieces.

Alex canâ€™t relocate any of the pieces. Neither he can place any piece on top of other.

### Sample Input:

    5 3
    1 2 100
    2 5 100
    3 4 100

### Sample Output:

    160

### Explanation:

Initially each of the jar contains 0 candies

    0 0 0 0 0

First operation

    100 100 0 0 0

Second operation

    100 200 100 100 100

Third operation

    100 200 200 200 100

Total = 800, Average = 800 / 5 = 160
