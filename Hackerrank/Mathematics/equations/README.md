Equations
=========

Find the number of positive integral solutions for the equations (1/x) + (1/y) = 1/N! *(read 1 by n factorial)* Print a single integer which is the no of positive integral solutions modulo 1000007.

### Input:

N

### Output:

Number of positive integral solutions for (x,y) modulo 1000007

### Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^6

For each “a x” or “r x”, x will always be an integer which will fit in 32 bit signed integer.
