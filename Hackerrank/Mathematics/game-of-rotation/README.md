Game of Rotation
================

Mark is an undergraduate student and he is interested in rotation. A conveyor belt competition is going on in the town which Mark wants to win. In the competition, thereâ€™s A conveyor belt which can be represented as a strip of *1 x N* blocks. Each block has a number written on it. The belt keeps rotating in such a way that after each rotation, each block is shifted to left of it and the first block goes to last position.

There is a switch near the conveyer belt which can stop the belt. Each participant would be given a single chance to stop the belt and his *PMEAN* would be calculated.

*PMEAN* is calculated using the sequence which is there on the belt when it stops. The participant having highest *PMEAN* is the winner. There can be multiple winners.

Mark wants to be among the winners. What *PMEAN* he should try to get which guarantees him to be the winner.

![PMEAN](https://hr-challenge-images.s3.amazonaws.com/game-of-rotation.jpg)

where *i* is the index of a block at the conveyor belt when it is stopped. Indexing starts from 1.

### Input:

First line contains N denoting the number of elements on the belt.  
Second line contains N space separated integers.

### Output:

Output the required PMEAN

### Constraints:

* 1 <= N <= 10<sup>6</sup>
* -10<sup>9</sup> <= each number <= 10<sup>9</sup>

### Sample Input:

    3
    20 30 10

### Sample Output:

    140

### Explanation:

Number on top can be written in these manners.  
Initial numbers on belt, 20 30 10 => *PMEAN* = 1x20 + 2x30 + 3x10 = 110  
After first rotation, 30 10 20 => *PMEAN* = 1x30 + 2x10 + 3x20 = 110  
After second rotation, 10 20 30 => *PMEAN* = 1x10 + 2x20 + 3x30 = 140  
So maximum possible value will be 140.
