nCr table
=========

Jim is doing his discrete maths homework which requires him to repeatedly calculate <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> (n choose r) for different values of n. Knowing that this is time consuming, he goes to his sister June for help. June, being a computer science student knows how to convert this into a computer program and generate the answers quickly. She tells him, by storing the lower values of <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> (n choose r), one can calculate the higher values using a very simple formula.

If you are June, how will you calculate <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> values for different values of n?

### Input:

The first line contains the number of test cases T.

T lines follow each containing an integer n.

### Output:

For each n output the list of <sup>n</sup>C<sub>0</sub> to <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub> each separated by a single space in a new line. If the number is large, print only the last 9 digits. i.e. modulo 10<sup>9</sup>.

### Constraints:

* 1 <= T <= 200
* 1 <= n < 1000

### Sample Input:

    3
    2
    4
    5

### Sample Output:

    1 2 1
    1 4 6 4 1
    1 5 10 10 5 1

### Explanation:

For 2 we can check <sup>2</sup>C<sub>0</sub> <sup>2</sup>C<sub>1</sub> and <sup>2</sup>C<sub>2</sub> are 1, 2 and 1 respectively. The other inputsâ€™ answer follow similar pattern.
