Find Point
==========

Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q.

### Input:

First line contains an integer T representing the number of testcases (T <= 15). Each test case contains Px Py Qx Qy representing the (x,y) coordinates of P and Q, all of them being integers.

### Constraints:

* 1 <= T <= 15
* -100 <= x, y <= 100

### Output:

For each test case output x and y coordinates of the symmetric point

### Sample Input:

    1
    0 0 1 1

### Sample Output:

    2 2
