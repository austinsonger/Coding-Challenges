Stars
====

Little John has drawn N stars on his paper. John likes all the stars but not equally. More precisely he likes star number i with weight v<sub>i</sub>. He draws a line that divides the paper into two parts such that each part has a subset of stars in them. Let the weight of each part be the summation of weights of the stars in the part. He wants to draw the line such that the difference in the sum of weights between the two parts is as small as possible while maximizing the smaller partâ€™s weight. Your task is to compute the weight of smaller part corresponding to this desired line. No stars are allowed to be on the line.

### Input:

The first line of the input contains an integer n.

Each of next N lines contains three integers x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub> specifying the positions of i<sup>th</sup> star and v<sub>i</sub>.

N is at most 100.

No three points lie on a line.

All the input numbers are between -10<sup>9</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup>.

v<sub>i</sub> is between 1 and 1000.

### Output:

Print an integer being the answer to the test.
