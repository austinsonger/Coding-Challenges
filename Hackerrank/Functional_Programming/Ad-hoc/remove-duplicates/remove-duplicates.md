Explanation 
Test Case #00: Here you have to remove 'a' at index 1 (0 based indexing) because it has already appeared at index 0.
Test Case #01: Here you have to remove 'c' from index 1, 6 and 7, because 'c' has already appeared at index 0. Similarly you have to remove 'b' from index 4 and 'a' from index 5.
