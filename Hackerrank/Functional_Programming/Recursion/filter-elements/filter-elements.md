Given a list of N integers A = [a1, a2, ..., aN], you have to find those integers which are repeated at least K times. In case no such element exists you have to print -1.

If there are multiple elements in A which are repeated at least K times, then print these elements ordered by their first occurrence in the list.

Let's say A = [4, 5, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4] and K = 2. Then the output is

4 5 3
because these numbers have appeared at least 2 times. 
Among these numbers, 
4 has appeared first at position 1, 
5 has appeared next at position 2, 
and 3 has appeared thereafter at position 6. 
That's why, we print in the order 4, 5 and finally 3.

Input 
First line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. 
Each test case consist of two lines. First line will contain two space separated integers, N and K, where N is the size of list A, and K represents the repetition count. In the second line, there are N space separated integers which represent the elements of list A = [a1, a2, ..., aN].

Output 
For each test case, you have to print all those integers which have appeared in the list at least K times in the order of their first appearance, separated by space. If no such element exists, then print -1.

Constraints 
1 <= T <= 10 
1 <= N <= 10000 
1 <= K <= N 
1 <= ai <= 109

Sample Input

3
9 2
4 5 2 5 4 3 1 3 4
9 4
4 5 2 5 4 3 1 3 4
10 2
5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

4 5 3
-1
5 4 3 2 1
Explanation 
Sample Case #01: This is the same example mentioned in the problem statement above. 
Sample Case #02: As no elements repeats more than 3 times, we don't have any elements satisfying the criteria of minimum K times. 
Sample Case #03: All elements are repeated 2 times. So we print all of them according to their order of occurance, which is 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.
