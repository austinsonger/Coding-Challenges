Update the values of a list with their absolute values. The input and output portions will be handled automatically during grading. You only need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

Input Format

There are N integers, each on a separate line. These are the N elements of the input array.

Output Format

Output the absolute value of N integers, each on a separate line in the same input order.

Sample Input

2
-4
3
-1
23
-4
-54
Sample Output

2
4
3
1
23
4
54
Constraints

The list will have no more than 100 integers. 
Each integer, X, in the list: -100<=X<=100

Recommended Method Signature

Number Of Parameters: 1
Parameters: [list]
Returns: List or Vector

For Hackers Using other Languages

You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow the input/output format mentioned above.

NOTE: You only need to submit the code above after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.
