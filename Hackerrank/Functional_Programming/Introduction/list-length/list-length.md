Output Format

Output a single integer N, the length of the list that was provided as input.

Sample Input

You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow the input/output format mentioned above.

NOTE: You only need to submit the code above after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.
