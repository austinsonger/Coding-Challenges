/*
 * Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 
 * 0 <= i <= num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and 
 * return them as an array.
 * 
 * Example:
 * For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time 
 * O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a 
 * single pass?
 * Space complexity should be O(n).
 * Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like 
 * __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
 * Hint:
 * 
 * You should make use of what you have produced already.
 * Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to 
 * generate new range from previous.
 * Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number 
 * of 1s?
