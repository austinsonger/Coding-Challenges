/*
 * Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the 
 * length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

 * This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
 * 
 * Note:
 * Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input:
 * "abccccdd"
 * 
 * Output:
 * 7
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
