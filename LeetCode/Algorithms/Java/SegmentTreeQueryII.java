/*
 * For an array, we can build a SegmentTree for it, each node stores an extra 
 * attribute count to denote the number of elements in the the array which 
 * value is between interval start and end. (The array may not fully filled by 
 * elements)

Design a query method with three parameters root, start and end, find the 
number of elements in the in array's interval [start, end] by the given root of 
value SegmentTree.

Notice
It is much easier to understand this problem if you finished Segment Tree 
Buildand Segment Tree Query first.

Example
For array [0, 2, 3], the corresponding value Segment Tree is:

                     [0, 3, count=3]
                     /             \
          [0,1,count=1]             [2,3,count=2]
          /         \               /            \
   [0,0,count=1] [1,1,count=0] [2,2,count=1], [3,3,count=1]
query(1, 1), return 0

query(1, 2), return 1

query(2, 3), return 2

query(0, 2), return 2
