/*
 * Write a function that add two numbers A and B. You should not use + or any 
 * arithmetic operators.

Example
Given a=1 and b=2 return 3

Note
There is no need to read data from standard input stream. Both parameters are 
given in function aplusb, you job is to calculate the sum and return it.

Challenge
Of course you can just return a + b to get accepted. But Can you challenge not 
do it like that?

Clarification
Are a and b both 32-bit integers?

Yes.
Can I use bit operation?

Sure you can.
