/*
 * Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design 
 * and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it 
 * essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to 
 * next().

 * Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning 
 * of the list: [1, 2, 3].
 * 
 * Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
 * 
 * Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after 
 * that still return 2.
 * 
 * You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling 
 * hasNext() after that should return false.
 * 
 * Hint:
 * 
 * Think of "looking ahead". You want to cache the next element.
 * Is one variable sufficient? Why or why not?
 * Test your design with call order of peek() before next() vs next() before 
 * peek().
 * For a clean implementation, check out Google's guava library source code.
 * Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all 
 * types, not just integer?
