/*
 * Given an integer array, adjust each integers so that the difference of every 
 * adjacent integers are not greater than a given number target.

If the array before adjustment is A, the array after adjustment is B, you should 
minimize the sum of |A[i]-B[i]|

 Notice

You can assume each number in the array is a positive integer and not greater 
than 100.

Example
Given [1,4,2,3] and target = 1, one of the solutions is [2,3,2,3], the 
adjustment cost is 2 and it's minimal.

Return 2.
