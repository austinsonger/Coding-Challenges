/*
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, 
 * labeled from 0 to n - 1.

 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example 
 * to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, 
 * which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * 
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of 
 * prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of 
 * courses you should take to finish all courses.
 * 
 * There may be multiple correct orders, you just 
 * need to return one of them. If it is impossible 
 * to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * 2, [[1,0]]
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take 
 * course 1 you should have finished course 0. So 
 * the correct course order is [0,1]
 * 
 * 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
 * There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take 
 * course 3 you should have finished both courses 
 * 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken 
 * after you finished course 0. So one correct 
 * course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct 
 * ordering is[0,2,1,3].
 * 
 * Note:
 * The input prerequisites is a graph represented 
 * by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read 
 * more about how a graph is represented.
