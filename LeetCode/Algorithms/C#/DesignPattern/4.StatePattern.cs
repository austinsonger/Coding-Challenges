/**
The State Pattern (also referred to as State Design Pattern) is one of the behavioral patterns. 
It defines a manner for controlling communication among classes or entities. 
It is used to change the behavior of the object when the object's internal state is changed. 
This pattern helps objects to change it state without changing the interface (used to access the object) 
or lose the current state. This change of the stateÂ of the class or object is hidden from the outer world with 
the use of a context (also known as wrapper object). 
The State Pattern can be used to implement complex decision-making algorithms represented as a flow chart or state diagram. 
A State Pattern can also be implement where various states exist and each state has a specific action.
